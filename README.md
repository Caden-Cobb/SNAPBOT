# SNAPBot-pt-2
Use this alongside the [auto-clicker](https://murgaa.com) for a fully autonomous snap score bot. (Use [THESE time](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xz3ZlKIa09hNs7gcDrbt-MsZmr5cDJBc/view?usp=sharing) values for ~10.8k an hour.) Do know the faster it goes the lesser the stabilty.



Step One: Download the auto-clicker and allow all permissions, After Open web.snapchat.com select full screen. (Have python and your ide of choice installed/updated.) 

Step Two: From here select a key to select mouse postion (Via the auto clicker) after, Place your mouse over every corresponding spot, Pressing Your key of choice each time, after each location, go into the app to save it.

Step Three: After successfully logging each location (Take snap, Send snap, Select, etc..) It's time to select a Key, in my case "Q" to execute the auto-clicker. 

Step Four: Download the "main.py" file, You will need the following libraries installed: (pyautogui,schedule) Use the simple pip command in the terminal to install them. You will also need a [CHROMEDRIVER](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) downloaded extracted and placed in the same folder as yo
ur "main.py"  

Step Five: Go to your IDE and run the script whilst in a timely manner opening your chrome browser with snap and setting it to full screen, The script will then begin, click your start key to initiate the auto clicker. 

At this point your snap score bot should be working.... I reccomend you tune the time in between clicks as quick as your pc can handle. In doing so, You should expect a 200k+ Snap score increase every 24 hours.
